      <h2>Welcome to Trust The Process</h2>
      <p>Your journey to a stronger, healthier you starts here. We're here to guide you through effective workouts and essential nutrition tips. Everything you need to crush your goals.</p>
      <p>Remember, results don’t happen overnight. This isn’t a race, it’s a marathon. Stay consistent, stay focused... and trust the process.</p>

      <h2>Nutrition Overview</h2>
      <p>Nutrition is just as important, if not more important, than training when it comes to reaching your goals. Whether you're trying to lose fat, gain muscle, or both, understanding your calorie intake is key. Tools like MyFitnessPal make it easier to stay on track, but it’s more about awareness than perfection.</p>
      <p>The basics? Eat in a deficit to lose fat, a surplus to build muscle, and prioritize protein no matter what. Quality matters too. Fueling your body with whole foods helps energy, recovery, and results.</p>
      <p>Diet isn't about restriction. It's about consistency and finding what works for you.</p>

    <div class="info-box">
      <h2>Workout Overview</h2>
      <p>Our training plan is built around the Push, Pull, Legs (PPL) workout split — one of the most basic and widely used routines, yet extremely effective. This split allows you to train all major muscle groups while giving each one around 48 hours to recover, which is ideal for muscle growth and performance.</p>
      <p>You’ll rotate between push days (chest, shoulders, triceps), pull days (back, biceps), and leg days (quads, hamstrings, glutes, calves) to hit each area with intensity and intention. It’s a simple structure that works — especially when paired with progressive overload and consistent effort.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="info-box">
  <h2>Rest & Recovery Overview</h2>
  <p>Rest is just as essential as training and nutrition when it comes to building muscle and making progress. Without proper recovery, your body doesn’t have time to repair and grow stronger. Overtraining can lead to fatigue, injury, and plateaus.</p>
  <p>By scheduling rest days, you allow your muscles to recover, reduce inflammation, and restore energy. It’s during rest — not workouts — that real growth happens. That’s why our plan includes rest at the right time to support consistency, performance, and long-term results.</p>
